I recently decided to make a new blog, after having a dead link on my website for multiple years on end.

I wanted it to be:

1. Fast

2. Simple and minimally designed

3. Easy to manage, via CMS or other.

## 1. Fast

### The stack
- NextJS
- MDX
- TailwindCSS
- Contentlayer

I decided to use Next.js, partially because I'm already familiar with it (due to that, I know it's fast in most situations), and partially because I've heard about MDX in Next.js, which I was curious about.

I quite like Next.js, as you can tell.

I also decided to use MDX over a traditional CMS like WordPress or Ghost because
1. It's self contained, which is a pro versus something hosted elsewhere that can intermittently go down.
2. I'm fairly comfortable with both Markdown (I use it for all my notes) and JSX (which is used in React).

## 2. Simple

TailwindCSS is the obvious choice here, due to it being a utility-first CSS framework, which means it's easy to make a simple design without having to write a lot of raw CSS.

CSS is hard and I don't like dealing with it.

Luckily, to get me writing even fewer styles, Tailwind also has a [typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) which has great looking defaults. All you need to do to use it is to

```bash
npm install @tailwindcss/typography
```

and

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
    //...
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
}
```

and \*tada*: I don't have to write styles for the main body of these blog posts.

I kept everything else fairly simple and clean, with the other main point of interest being the font, which is [Figtree](https://github.com/erikdkennedy/figtree) by Erik Kennedy. I find it fairly clean and readable - as much as something like Helvetica or Inter. I think it's a good all rounder - works well as a header, title, and body font.

## 3. Easy

I ended up picking MDX for this, as I mentioned earlier, due to its familiarity to me despite me never using it. File routings are also a plus, as I can just make and edit a new file in the 'posts' folder and it'll be a new post.

Instead of using a posts.json file with all my post metadata in that, I decided to pivot to a frontmatter-based system. I already have it included for SEO reasons, so I might as well use it for other metadata.
Here's the one for this page, actually:
```md
---
title: "Making my new Next.js MDX blog"
datePublished: "2024-10-25"
summary: "An overview of how I made my blog in Next.js and MDX"
---
```

I then use Contentlayer to scan the directory, fetch the data, and return it as a json object. I then render the raw markdown using a helper tool in the Contentlayer library, and pass it to the MDX component to render
like this:

```jsx
export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  // Find the post for the current page.
  const post = allPosts.find((post) => {
    console.log(post._raw.flattenedPath);
    return post._raw.flattenedPath === params.slug;
  });
// ...
  return (
    <div className={`mx-auto max-w-prose py-8`}>
      {/*...*/}
      <MDX code={post.body.code} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
I've got a few components as well that I use when rendering to make things like photos look nice.

## Conclusion
It was quite fun making this, and it only took me like two days! Most of the issues was working out MDX issues and certain packages (like `remark-gfm`) having compat issues with Contentlayer.
