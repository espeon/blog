## Hello!

Welcome to my second 'weekly' post! If you don't already know, this is my series of posts on what I did over the past week.
Most of the 'work' I did was on my project [atp.tools](https://atp.tools), which is a collection of tools for reading and doing ATProto things.

It was a slower week than usual, so I hope you forgive the shorter post.

## Code

Most of my code was focused on adding new features (including a minigame!) to make [atp.tools](https://atp.tools) that much more fun and engaging.
I don't want to talk about the minigame too much, but I'm really excited for people to find it, try it out,
and hopefully post about it on Bluesky! I'm planning on creating an AppView, and leaderboards, and some social features, such as posting your scores directly to Bluesky.

I've also started working on integrating the [Constellation](https://github.com/atcosm/links/tree/main/constellation) API into atp.tools.
Right now it's pretty basic, but I have plenty of ideas on how to integrate it more fully into the site.

A few days ago, there was a post on Bluesky going over CORS and why they don't particularly like it. I saw that, said "glad all of my services have cors enabled"
and immediately checked [Geranium](https://github.com/espeon/geranium). oops. I'm not sure what I was thinking, but I'm glad I checked it out.
Ended up setting up and permanently enabling CORS immediately after.

## Music

Been listening to a lot of [Enter Shikari](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3581716?u) recently. They're a great band but not known nearly so much as they should be in the US. 
Like a Robbie Williams.

Also, [Atlas Genius](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/4603417?u)! I haven't listened to them since high school before this week or so, but it's nice to hear them again.

Spiritbox also released a new single, "[No Loss, No Love](https://tidal.com/browse/album/415780330?u)". Sounds like a return to their roots, focusing less on melodic elements and more on raw intensity and Courtney's screams.
She does a lot of screaming here, definitely more like [their self titled](https://tidal.com/browse/album/168954033?u) versus [The Fear of Fear](https://tidal.com/browse/album/323766599?u).

Kyle Gordon also released a new track, "[We Will Never Die](https://tidal.com/browse/track/416327772?u)"! It's legitimately a good song (if you consider it's a parody) in the vein of early Vance Joy, Fun, The Lumineers and other millennial pop-folk stuff.

## Yeah.

That should be it. Glad I released this post in time. I definitely enjoyed writing this, and I'm looking forward to the next one. See you all in a week!
