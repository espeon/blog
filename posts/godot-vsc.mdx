summary: "Supercharge your game dev workflow by using VSCode instead of Godot's text editor"
---

When I was beginning with Godot, it was fairly daunting. Especially the text editor. 
It didn't come with a lot of specific features I expect on modern text editors (pseudo IDEs lol). 
After some time struggling with its internal editor, I finally decided to research ways to use VSCode instead.

I love intellisense. It's the best. so good. and actual LSPs, oh my god.

Anyways.

This is the result of my research.

### What?
There are a few steps.
1. Install Godot, and have it in your path
2. Install VSCode and the godot-tools plugin
3. Configure the plugin

Easy, right? Let’s dive deeper into it, just in case.

### Installing Godot
This step is really important. You need to install Godot to use it, and you want to have it **in your path** to be able to use godot-tools easily.

On MacOS:

```sh
brew install godot # or godot-mono
```

On Windows, if you have Scoop

```sh
scoop install godot # or godot-mono
```

I have a Mac, so the Windows instruction could be wrong, or there could be a better way to do it. Let me know either way (open an issue or PR)

Either way, if you can run `godot --help` afterwards, you're good to go.

You’ll want to set these options in your Editor settings at
Text Editor > External

Exec Path: Your VSCode executable - on MacOS it’s probably `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron`

Exec Flags: `{project} --goto {file}:{line}:{col}`


### Installing VSCode
You probably have it, but if you don’t this should help: https://code.visualstudio.com

The plugin you’ll need is godot-tools, found here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geequlim.godot-tools

It should auto-detect your Godot install given you have it in your path, and when you click on an item in Godot, it should automatically open your project and file in VSCode.

### Configuring godot-tools
You probably don’t need to. Though, if you didn’t follow step 1, you will need to change your editor path - it will prompt you in the bottom right corner.

## After
You’ll have intellisense, syntax highlighting, and more in VSCode. You can optionally use AI based tools like GitHub Copilot, and other VSCode extensions with your code without weird workarounds.
